# Python Data Model
```{note}
Most of the discussion in this chapter applies to sequences in general, from the famil‚Äê
iar list to the str and bytes types added in Python 3. Specific topics on lists, tuples,
arrays, and queues are also covered here, but the specifics of Unicode strings and byte
sequences appear in Chapter 4. Also, the idea here is to cover sequence types that are
ready to use. Creating your own sequence types is the subject of Chapter 12.
