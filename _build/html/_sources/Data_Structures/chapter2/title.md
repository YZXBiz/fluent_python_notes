# An Array of Sequences
```{note}
Most of the discussion in this chapter applies to sequences in general, from the familiar list to the str and bytes types added in Python 3. Specific topics on lists, tuples, arrays, and queues are also covered here, but the specifics of Unicode strings and byte sequences appear in Chapter 4. Also, the idea here is to cover sequence types that are ready to use. Creating your own sequence types is the subject of Chapter 12.
```
These are the main topics this chapter will cover:
- List comprehensions and the basics of generator expressions
- Using tuples as records versus using tuples as immutable lists
- Sequence unpacking and sequence patterns
- Reading from slices and writing to slices
- Specialized sequence types, like arrays and queues
